## Installation

Add `hyperlog-simd` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
hyperlog-simd = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example to get started:

```rust
use hyperlog_simd::{HyperLogLog, HyperLogLogPlusPlus};

let mut hll = HyperLogLog::new();
hll.add("hello");
hll.add("world");

let count = hll.estimate();
println!("Estimated distinct count: {}", count);

let mut hllpp = HyperLogLogPlusPlus::new();
hllpp.add("hello");
hllpp.add("world");

let count_pp = hllpp.estimate();
println!("Estimated distinct estimate (HLL++): {}", count_pp);
```

For detailed examples and documentation, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/hyperlog-simd).

## Benchmark

This library provides impressive performance gains on platforms that support SIMD. Benchmarks will be updated periodically, and you can also run them yourself using:
